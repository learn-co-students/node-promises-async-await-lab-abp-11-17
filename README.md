# Module Exports in Node Lab

## Objectives

1. Export an object through `module.exports`
2. Require an object through `require`

## Instructions

Included in this lab are two files, `models/Icebreaker.js` and `models/Question.js`. Both files need to export the classes defined within each file to `module.exports`.

Additionally, `models/Icebreaker.js` must `require` `models/Question.js` and load the export from that file to a `const` named `Question`.
